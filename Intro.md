# User Hackable HBridge84 Project

This is the User Hackable HBridge84 Project. 

It's purpose is to be a compact driver board for cars or robots. 

## Brains

The microcontroller used by this project is the ATtiny84 chip manufactured by Atmel. 
To program this chip using the [Arduino environment](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), you will first need the [ATtiny board definition file](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695) from [High Low Tech](http://highlowtech.org/). 



It includes:

* a C++ library for the Arduino IDE
* the Eagle Cad schematic and board layout files

# Arduino Installation

1. Start with a recent install of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
2. Install the [ATtiny library from High Low Tech](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695).
3. Make sure you have an AVR ICSP programmer like the [Sparkfun Pocket AVR Programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825) with it's drivers installed. 
4. Install this library by placing this entire folder as a subfolder in your Arduino/libraries folder.
